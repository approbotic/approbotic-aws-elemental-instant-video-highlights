# catfinder5004 "Automated Sports Clipping"

This version uses the basis of catfinder5001-parse but is designed to monitor a scoreboard of a Hockey Livestream and make decisions based upon a "Goal" ( increase of score ) and a "Shot" ( increase of the shot clock ). This is a work in progress and was hardcoded for the NAB2018 demo. It was very scrappy and is not complete. I would not suggest using this as-is, but I am including the code as I make it more robust.
